# Database Exporter

Database Exporter is a simple CLI tool that can export Postgres and SQL Server databases into a duckdb database and directory of parquet files.

Unlike a python script, this can be compiled to  a binary and be dropped on Linux / Windows / Mac remote server without the need to configure a virtual environment. It can also run periodically to make fetching snapshots easier.


See the [documentation](https://ryangreenup.github.io/database_exporter/) for more details.
